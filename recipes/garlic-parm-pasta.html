            <img src="garlic-parm-pasta.jpeg" alt="Forkful of creamy garlic parm pasta">

        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The easiest and <em>creamiest</em> pasta you will make with minimal number of ingredients and even fewer dishes to do afterwards (which is always a win in my book). That way, you have more time in the day to do what it is you would rather be doing.</p>
            <p>To take this dish to the next level, I suggest adding herbs like basil, a protein source of your choice (chicken, shrimp, tempeh), or some veggies (peas, broccoli, etc). Post your pictures and variations of this dish below!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 cup milk, or more, as needed</li>
                <li>8 oz uncooked fettuccine</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 min</li>
                <li>Stir in chicken broth, milk, and fettucine; Season with salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked through (about 18-20 min). Stir in Parmesan. If the mixture is too thick, add more milk as needed until desired consistency is reached</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
